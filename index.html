<br>
 <br>
Up to 6 months old: no screen time
6 months to 2 years old: use screen time only for interactive social play with an adult or to video chat with loved ones
          <br>
          <br>
2 to 5 years old: no more than one hour of screen time
         <br>
          <br> 
          
School-aged kids: no set time limit, but parents should limit social media use and gaming
